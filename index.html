        <h3>Bowties & Broccoli</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>  As I mentioned previously I have been trying to incorporate more vegtables into my diet. Broccoli is my favorite type of vegtables, so I found another quick recipe consisting of alot of broccoli. Similar to the previous recipe I posted, but this one consists of pasta and broccoli. This is a simple recipe that takes around 15 minutes to make. It is a great way to balance out your carbs with your veggies.
